Welcome to the APWine official blog!
 
This is where most updates will be posted, along with our social network links ([Telegram](https://t.me/APWineFinance), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apwinefinance)).
 
With the rise of DeFi technologies, users are witnessing very volatile and speculative APY varying depending on the platforms, such as [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/).
 
We are publicly announcing APWine today with the objective of launching a new, unique financial tool to trade and bet on these variations in APY.
 
The APWine [whitepaper](https://apwine.fi/APWine___Whitepaper.pdf), although a work in progress, is already available and gives more information on the logic behind the protocol and platform.
 
Our vision as a team (Gaspard, Antoine & I) is to bring innovation and move the DeFi ecosystem forward, while making this novel tool progressively decentralized in its governance and functioning.
 
Stay tuned for the next blog post, where we will introduce the governance token for APWine and the linked tokeneconomics.
