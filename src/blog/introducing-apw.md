title: "Introducing the APW Token"

With the alpha set to release this month on the Testnet, we would like to introduce the APW token linked to the platform.

# Governance

The owner rights on the smart contracts of the APWine protocol are initially divided equally between the core members of the team.

After a defined development period of **80 weeks**, the governance of those contracts will be handed over to a DAO, where the token holders can vote on the changes to be made (treasury allocation, protocol upgrade, etc.). The token distribution is designed so that the community and stakeholders of the APWine  platform progressively earn tokens that will give them a voting power on the DAO that will be realized after the initial development period.

# Allocation

The total supply will be of **1'000'000 APW**.

They will be allocated according to the following distribution:

- **100'000** first tokens are sold to the community through a 5:95 ETH/APW Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP). It's a pool created on the protocol Balancer and allows the team to choose the price of the token during the sale while staying decentralized. Those tokens are sold to provide the development team with some initial capital for the development costs (mainly gas and audits).
- **28'000 APW** are locked for a vesting period of 80 weeks for the core team and advisors.
- **872'000 APW** are unlocked progressively on a weekly basis (for 80 weeks).

Of those weekly 10'900 APW,
- **10'000 APW** are allocated to liquidity mining. This means users of the platform who deposit funds will be rewarded with APW tokens proportionally.
- **900 APW** are allocated to the team fund for their work on the project.

This distribution will later be reflected in the official [whitepaper](http://localhost:8000/APWine___Whitepaper.pdf).

# Economics

Along with the governance that this token provides, token holders are incentivized to act in a positive direction with the protocol and its development.

For each future that expires, **1% of the collected yield** is redistributed to the token holders, proportionally to the amount they hold. The governance mechanism of the protocol will entitle them to decide on a different percentage or other rewards.
