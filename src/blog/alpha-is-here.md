The Alpha version of **APWine** is now deployed and open to the public on the **Kovan** test network, on [APWine Alpha](https://alpha.apwine.fi/).

**APWine Alpha**, or codename *Muscat*, will let you try the platform with **cDAI** for fixed periods of **1 week**.

We've designed the interface to make it as simple as possible to use and understand, but for newcomers we've written a step-by-step tutorial you can find below.

# Tutorial

First of all, make sure you are on the **Kovan** test network. This can usually be set from the settings menu of your wallet.

## 1. Getting some ETH and cDAI

You will need **ETH** to fuel interactions on the platform. There are several faucets online, including [Kovan Faucet](https://faucet.kovan.network/) and [Gitter Kovan Faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet#). If these don't work, please reach out to a team member and we'll help you get on track.

**cDAI** can be obtained directly on the [Compound App](https://app.compound.finance/). Once connected to your wallet, head to your dashboard and, in the **Supply** section, click on the **Collateral** toggle next to **Ether**. Confirm you want to use **ETH** as collateral. Back to your dashboard, in the **Supply** section, click on **Ether**. This time, a window should open. Enter any amount of **ETH**, but keep some for your future transactions (e.g. keep 0.1 if you've received 1 before). Click on **Supply** and wait for the transaction to be accepted.

You've provided **ETH** as collateral, you now need to borrow some **Dai**. In the **Borrowing** section, click on **Dai Stablecoin**, then either enter an amount you want to borrow or click on **Safe Max**. Press **Borrow**. Once accepted, you will have some **Dai** in your wallet. Free (test) money!

Next, from your dashboard, click again on **Dai** and, this time, enter an amount of **Dai** you want to supply. You can click on **MAX** to supply all of your **Dai** automatically. Then click on **Supply** and send the transaction. Your funds are now locked on Compound and you get some **cDAI** in return.

You're now (test) **cDAI** rich, and ready to use **APWine**!

## 2. Depositing on APWine

Head over to [APWine Alpha](https://alpha.apwine.fi/) and connect your wallet.

You should land on the **Overview** homepage. From the side navigation bar, go to **Deposit**.

**cDAI** should automatically be selected. Enter an amount or click the **MAX** button, then **Approve** the spend when prompted. After the transaction has been processed, you should now be able to **Deposit** your **cDAI**.

You can confirm your **cDAI** was deposited on the platform by checking the *Deposited* label on the left or by checking your **Dashboard**. 

## 3. Registering to a period

Navigate to the **Register** page. If the next period is available to register, you should see an "*Upcoming Period*" message with the start and duration of the period.

To register for this period, simply enter an amount of **cDAI** you want to provide and click **Register**. This amount of **cDAI** will be locked till the end of the period, and then released back to your **APWine** deposited balance.

![Register](./tutorial/register.png)

After the transaction is complete, you can check that your **cDAI** was correctly registered with either the *Locked* label of directly through your **Dashboard**.

At the start date of the period, you will automatically be sent your tokenized yield in the form of **WXCDAI** tokens, where *X* is the period index, starting from 0.

*Note: The start of the period may* **not** *be exactly the time indicated, since it has to be started manually for now. Nonetheless, directly after the given period date, you will* **not** *be able to register any longer.*

## 4. Trading your WXCDAI

Your funds are locked, the period has started, and you now have a corresponding tokenized yield in your wallet. Great! Let's start trading.

We've deployed a custom **0x** exchange which you can access from the **Trade** button in the navigation bar.

## 5. Claiming your yield

The period has now ended and your initial funds have been unlocked back into your deposited balance. But you still have your tokenized yield, that you either sold, hodled or traded for more!

To claim your interests, go to the **Claim** page. The corresponding settings will be selected automatically.

If the period has ended and the interests are available to claim, you should see the **Claim** button at the bottom.

*Note: You can selected your desired period by clicking on the* **Previous** *and* **Next** *buttons on the side. No worries, your yield will always be available to claim, even when the next period starts!*
