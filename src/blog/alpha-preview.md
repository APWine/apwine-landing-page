The Alpha version of the APWine web app is on the way to deployment on the Testnet, and will be announced soon.

In the meantime, we would like to give the community an overview of the interface and user experience.

Presenting **APWine Alpha**.

# User Experience

The Alpha is designed to be simple and intuitive for newcomers, as well as more experienced DeFi users.

## Deposit

After connecting your wallet with MetaMask, you will have the option of depositing an initial amount of tokens on the platform. Only **cDAI** will be available to deposit during the Alpha.

## Register

This is the main part of the app where you will be able to lock your deposited tokens on a specific platform, for a fixed period of time.

### Platform
During the Alpha, only **Compound** will be available to try. We are currently working on **Aave** integration, and will progressively add new platforms on the Mainnet release according to the community suggestions.

### Duration
For the Alpha, you will be able to lock your funds for a period of **1 week**. In the final release, you will be free to choose between **daily**, **weekly** and **monthly** periods, converting your yield into futures.

## Claim

At the end of each registration period, the generated yield corresponding to the tokenized futures will be claimable in exchange for these tokens. In practice, this means your tokenized yield can be traded during the entire period, allowing you to speculate on the variation of APY for your selected platform / token pair.

# What's Next

The APWine team is finishing the contract interface with the web app for deployment on the Testnet, and making sure the experience is as smooth as possible.

After launching the Alpha, we plan on auditing the **APW** ERC20 contract and set up the token sale directly on the APWine web app. More news related to the sale will be coming soon.
